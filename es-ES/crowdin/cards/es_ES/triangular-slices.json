  "Let us number the vertices of the heptagon from 1 to 7 counter-clockwise. Let us focus our attention on a fixed edge, say the one with vertices 1 and 2. When the edge is present in the triangle with the extra vertex 3, then the heptagon is split in that triangle and the hexagon at its left (with vertices 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7). For the latter, the problem is the exact same you solved before, e.g. you get 14 ways of triangulating it. Then consider when the fixed edge forms a triangle with vertex 4. At the right of that triangle you have one triangle (with vertices 2, 3, and 4), whereas at the left you have a pentagon (with vertices 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7) for which we know you can do 5 triangulations. Therefore, this case provides you with 5×1 = 5 triangulations.\nLet us consider the case when the fixed edge forms a triangle with a vertex 5.
