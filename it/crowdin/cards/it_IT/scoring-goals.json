  "Imagine the score was only 3 - 2. Let us think about three goals scored by the first(home) team (HHH) and two goals scored by the second (away) team (AA). We could try and list the possibilities. e.g. AAHHH would represent the first two goals scored by the away team and then the next three goals scored by the home team. All the options for the five goals are : AAHHH, AHAHH, AHHAH, AHHHA, HAAHH, HAHAH, HAHHA, HHAAH, HHAHA, HHHAA. There are 10 options in total. A way to calculate this is to think about there being 5 options for one away goal: _ <em> _ </em> _ it could be in one of any of the 5 positions (e.g. A _ <em> _ </em>) . The other away goal could be in one of the remaining 4 positions. So you would think there would be 5×4 = 20 ways of choosing where the two goals would go.   However, we have double counted, because we have included every possibility (e.g. AAHHH) twice (one goal in position 1 and the other in position 2 but also the other way around). The order in which we selected the 2 goals of the second team does not matter: we need to divide by 2. So the answer if the score was 5 - 2 is 5×4 ∕ 2 = 10.": "Imagine the score was only 3 - 2.

  "For the question of how many ways can the goals be scored if the score is 5 - 2, we can use the same logic. There are 7 possibilities to select the position for one goal; then there are 7 - 1 = 6 possibilities to select the position of the other goal (\"-1\" because one position has already been selected), therefore you get 7×6 = 42.

  "Combinatorics is an area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting. Two big aspects of combinatorics are finding combinations and permutations. For combinations the order does not matter - like in our football example we didn't mind which order the away team scored the goals.
