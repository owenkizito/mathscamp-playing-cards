Abundant Numbers

# Metadata

## Type

fun fact

# Main Version

## Statement

The integer 12 is the first **abundant number**. Its proper divisors (factors not including 12 itself)  are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 which add up to 16 which is more than 12. 

## Hint

You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the abundant numbers.

## Explanation

The next abundant number is 20, because the proper divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5, and 10 which add up to 22. Can you explain why prime numbers can never be abundant?   

# Extension 1

## Statement

Numbers whose proper divisors add up to less than the number are called deficient numbers. 

## Hint

You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the deficient numbers.

## Explanation

An example of a deficient number is 15, because 1,3, and 5 add up to 9 which is less than 15.

# Extension 2 

Statement

If the proper divisors of a number add up to the number itself then the number is called perfect. 

## Explanation

Take the proper divisors of 6, they are 1,2, and 3 which adds up perfectly to 6.

6 is the smallest perfect number. Can you find the only other perfect number below 100?

# Additional information

## About

The first known classification of numbers as deficient, perfect or abundant was by Nicomachus in his Introductio Arithmetica (circa 100)
