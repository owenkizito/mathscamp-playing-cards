## Statement

If you could fold a piece of paper in half 42 times, it would reach the Moon! 

## Hint

Let us say that the paper thickness is about 0.1 millimeter (or 0.0039 inch). If you fold it once on itself, how thick would it be? What about it you fold it once more on itself? What about if you fold it 10 times?

## Explanation

The distance between the Earth and the Moon is a bit less than 400000 kilometers (or 250000 miles). For us the paper is 0.1 millimeter (mm) thick. If we fold the paper once, its thickness would be doubled, so it becomes 0.2mm. Folding it again gives 0.4mm. If we fold it 10 times, it becomes (0.1mm)×2¹⁰ (two to the power 10). Now, if we compute (0.1mm)×2⁴², the result is 440 000km!

## Statement

How many times would you need to fold the same piece of paper to reach the height of Britam Tower, the highest skyscraper in Nairobi? (200m, or 640 ft)

## Hint

Make sure you convert 0.1mm to meters or 200m to millimeters first. 

## Explanation

You would need to fold the paper 21 times. 200m is 200000mm. You need to solve (0.1mm)×2ⁿ = 200000 for n. We can solve equations like these using logarithms or just trial and error - keep multiplying by 2 until you have reached the height of the tower … 20 is nearly enough, but you would need 21 folds to reach over 200m tall.

## About

Try to fold a piece paper 6 times, remember to fold it completely over itself at each repetition. Can you fold it a seventh time? An eighth? How far can you go? Maybe we need a larger piece of paper to begin with! It was thought for years that 7 was the maximum number of times a piece of paper could be folded, but in 2002 American teenager Britney Gallivan demonstrated that a sheet of paper can be folded 12 times, provided that it is long enough and thin enough.  Britney Gallivan demonstrated this by using a 1200m length of toilet paper, which provided her with both the length and thinness which she required.  Britney even came up with a formula that showed how long the piece of paper would have to be so it can be folded n times:

\[$$ L = \frac{\pi \times t}{6} (2^n + 4)(2^n - 1) $$\]\< L = π×t×(2ⁿ + 4)(2ⁿ - 1) ∕ 6 \>

L is the length of paper required, t is the thickness of the paper and n is how many folds you can make.

Ten years later in 2012 a group of students beat Britney's record by taking 16km of toilet roll and folding it in one direction 13 times.
